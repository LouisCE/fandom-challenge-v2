# Fandom Challenge V2

## Project Overview

Fandom Challenge V2 is a Python terminal-based quiz game that runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Players can test their knowledge of different gaming franchises (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and God of War) through multiple-choice questions.

Players begin by selecting a category, after which the program randomly generates a set of questions, ensuring variety and replayability with each playthrough. Answer options are also shuffled every round to prevent predictability. The game tracks player performance, validates input to handle errors gracefully, and rewards high-scoring players with a special celebratory ASCII message.

This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dictionaries, randomisation and user input validation. It also showcases the ability to build an interactive terminal application that balances fun gameplay with reliable, well-structured code.

## User Goals

- Enjoy a fun and engaging terminal-based quiz experience.
- Test knowledge of multiple gaming franchises.
- Understand the quiz rules before playing.
- Play from any device that can run a Python terminal.
- Receive instant feedback on answers.
- Answer options are randomised each time to ensure true knowledge is tested.
- Replay quizzes for better results and enhanced replayability.

## User Stories

1. As a new player, I want to run the quiz easily from the terminal.
2. As a player, I want the quiz to randomise questions so each game feels fresh.
3. As a player, I want answer options to appear in different orders to prevent memorisation.
4. As a player, I want immediate feedback after answering so I know if I was correct or incorrect.
5. As a player, I want to see my final score and high scores at the end.
6. As a player, I want different outcomes depending on my performance.
7. As a returning player, I want my high scores to persist between sessions for long-term progress.
8. As a player, I want to be able to replay the quiz without restarting the program.

## Website Goals and Objectives

- Build an interactive, terminal-based quiz game that is fun and engaging for fans of popular gaming franchises.
- Provide a simple, text-based interface that is easy to understand and navigate.
- Allow players to select a category and receive a randomised set of questions for variety and replayability.
- Shuffle answer options for each question to prevent predictability and keep the quiz challenging.
- Validate user input to handle errors gracefully and maintain a smooth game flow.
- Track and display player scores, rewarding high performers with a special celebratory ASCII message.
- Write clean, well-structured Python code that demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, functions, lists, dictionaries, and conditionals.
- Ensure the game runs reliably in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku, providing consistent performance.
- Use version control (Git/GitHub) for development, tracking progress and enabling easy maintenance.
- Test thoroughly to confirm that question randomisation, input validation, scoring, and ASCII feedback all function as expected.

## Features

- Choose from multiple quiz categories (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, God of War).
- Randomised questions within each quiz.
- Color-coded feedback for correct and incorrect answers.
- Score tracking and end-of-quiz results.
- Replay option to try again.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- Adding more quiz categories and questions.
- Implementing a timer for each question.
- Adding ASCII art or simple terminal graphics for visual engagement.
- Integrating keyboard shortcuts for faster input.
- Implementing leaderboard features (including user initials, top 10 scores and completion times).

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3:** Core programming language.
- **Colorama:** For colored terminal output.
- **Heroku:** Deployment platform.
- **GitHub:** Version control and source code hosting.

## Testing

Testing included:

- Manual testing of input handling and score calculation.
- Verifying randomisation of questions and answer order.
- Deployment testing on Heroku terminal.
- Error handling for invalid input or empty answers.

### Bug Testing Log

**Quiz Display Issues:**
- **Bug:** Quiz displayed all questions instead of 10 random.
  - **Observed Behavior:** All questions in the dataset appeared each time a quiz was played.
  - **Cause:** `for` loop iterated over `questions` instead of `selected_questions`.
  - **Resolution:** Changed the loop to `for i, q in enumerate(selected_questions, start=1)`.

**Answer Recognition Bugs:**
- **Bug:** Player answers always marked wrong.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Correct answers were not recognized; even valid choices returned "Wrong!".
  - **Cause:** Original code compared full option strings including old A/B/C/D prefixes.
  - **Resolution:** Stripped original letter prefix using `clean_options = [opt[3:].strip() ...]` and shuffled these clean options.

- **Bug:** Invalid choice error for valid input.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Input like 'A', 'B', etc., sometimes triggered "Invalid choice. Skipping question.".
  - **Cause:** Options were shuffled but mapping to labels was inconsistent.
  - **Resolution:** Added `option_mapping` dictionary mapping new labels A-D to shuffled options and checked input against this mapping.

**Superfan Message Bug:**
- **Bug:** Superfan ASCII displayed even for low scores.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Even scoring 5/10 triggered the superfan message.
  - **Cause:** ASCII print was outside the score check `else` block.
  - **Resolution:** Moved the ASCII celebration inside the `else` block that only executes for `score >= 9`.

**Score/Variable Errors:**
- **Bug:** `NameError: name 'score' is not defined`.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Crash when trying to print final score.
  - **Cause:** Some print statements were accidentally placed outside `play_quiz()` function.
  - **Resolution:** Ensured all `score` references are within the function scope and correctly indented.

**Indentation Issues:**
- **Bug:** Indentation errors.
  - **Observed Behavior:** `IndentationError: expected an indented block`.
  - **Cause:** Some blocks (loops, if/else) were not properly indented after major rewriting.
  - **Resolution:** Fixed all indentation consistently: 4 spaces per level, nested blocks 8+ spaces.

## Deployment

This project was deployed using Heroku:

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Create a new Heroku app.
3. In the **Settings** tab, add the following buildpacks in order:
   - `heroku/python`
   - `heroku/nodejs`
4. Set a config var:
   - `PORT` = `8000`
5. Connect the Heroku app to your GitHub repository.
