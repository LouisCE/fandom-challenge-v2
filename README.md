# Fandom Challenge

Fandom Challenge is a Python terminal-based quiz game that runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Players can test their knowledge of different gaming franchises (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and God of War) through multiple-choice questions.

## User Goals

- Enjoy a fun and engaging terminal-based quiz experience.
- Test knowledge of multiple gaming franchises.
- Understand the quiz rules before playing.
- Play from any device that can run a Python terminal.
- Receive instant feedback on answers.
- Answer options are randomised each time to ensure true knowledge is tested.
- Replay quizzes for better results and enhanced replayability.

## User Stories

1. As a new player, I want to run the quiz easily from the terminal.
2. As a player, I want the quiz to randomise questions so each game feels fresh.

5. As a player, I want to see my final score and high scores at the end.
6. As a player, I want different outcomes depending on my performance.
7. As a returning player, I want my high scores to persist between sessions for long-term progress.
8. As a player, I want to be able to replay the quiz without restarting the program.
