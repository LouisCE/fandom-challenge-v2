# Fandom Challenge V2

## Project Overview

Fandom Challenge V2 is a Python terminal-based quiz game that runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. Players can test their knowledge of different gaming franchises (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, and God of War) through multiple-choice questions.

Players begin by selecting a category, after which the program randomly generates a set of questions, ensuring variety and replayability with each playthrough. Answer options are also shuffled every round to prevent predictability. The game tracks player performance, validates input to handle errors gracefully, and rewards high-scoring players with a special celebratory ASCII message.

This project demonstrates core Python programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, lists, dictionaries, randomisation and user input validation. It also showcases the ability to build an interactive terminal application that balances fun gameplay with reliable, well-structured code.

## Design Choices

### Typography & Display

As this project runs entirely in a Python terminal, there is no traditional web typography or UI. Instead, design choices focus on readability, clarity, and creating a visually engaging experience through text alone.  

To enhance the presentation, the project uses **ASCII art** at key moments, such as the celebratory message for high-scoring players. This adds personality, variety, and a “retro terminal game” feel.  

### Colour Scheme

To create a more dynamic and immersive terminal experience, the project makes use of the **Colorama** library. This enables coloured text output in the terminal, helping to:

- **Differentiate categories** by displaying them in distinct colours.
- **Highlight correct and incorrect answers** with green and red for instant feedback.
- **Draw attention to the score and celebratory messages** with bright, contrasting colours.
- **Break up blocks of plain text** and make the interface more engaging to read.

The choice of colours was guided by readability and accessibility within a terminal environment. Bright colours are used sparingly for emphasis, while most text remains in neutral tones to avoid overwhelming the player.

### Atmosphere

Together, the combination of ASCII art and Colorama colours provides a strong sense of atmosphere. Despite the limitations of a text-only interface, these design elements help transform the quiz from a plain terminal application into a more **interactive, fun, and fandom-themed experience**.

*Note: Unlike a web-based project, this design did not rely on a strict predefined palette or typography system. Instead, colour choices and ASCII styling evolved naturally during development, guided by readability and player experience.*

## How to Play

Fandom Challenge V2 is a multiple-choice quiz game based on popular gaming franchises.

1. When the game starts, the player is asked to **choose a category** from the available options (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, or God of War).
2. The program then **randomly selects a set of questions** from the chosen category to create a unique quiz each round.
3. For each question, **four possible answers** (A-D) are displayed. The answer order is shuffled every time to prevent predictability and player memorisation from previous attempts.
4. The player types the letter (**A, B, C, or D**) that corresponds to their chosen answer.
   - If they get the answer right, the player recieves a "Correct!" message highlighted in **green**.
   - If they get the answer incorrect, the player recieves a "Wrong!" message shown in **red**, and the correct option is revealed.
5. The quiz continues until all ten selected questions have been answered.
6. At the end, the player receives their **final score out of 10**.
   - If the player scores **9 or above**, they are rewarded with a celebratory **ASCII art message**.

This simple but engaging gameplay loop makes the quiz fun, replayable and easy to understand.

## Features

  - Stores and displays the **highest scores across sessions** for that category.
  - Updates automatically when a new high score is achieved.
  - A **timer** runs in the background, adding urgency and challenge.
  - **Leaderboard ranking rules**:
    - Score takes priority in the rankings. Higher scores get higher rankings.
    - In the event of equal scores, faster completion times are ranked higher, acting as a tiebreaker.
  - Encourages replayability by letting players compete with themselves and others for the fastest and highest-scoring runs.
- Adds an extra layer of challenge and motivation beyond just completing the quiz.

- Implementing a timer for each question.
- Adding ASCII art or simple terminal graphics for visual engagement.
- Integrating keyboard shortcuts for faster input.
- Implementing leaderboard features (including user initials, top 10 scores and completion times).

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3:** Core programming language.
- **Colorama:** For colored terminal output.
- **Heroku:** Deployment platform.
- **GitHub:** Version control and source code hosting.

## Database Design

### Data Model

The quiz is structured around simple Python data types, making the logic clear and easy to extend:

- **Questions and Answers:**
  Each quiz question is stored in a **dictionary** containing the question text, a list of possible answers, and the correct answer. These dictionaries are grouped into lists by category (Jak and Daxter, Ratchet & Clank, God of War).

- **Randomisation:**
  The `random` module is used to shuffle both the **questions** and the **answer order** each round. This ensures replayability and prevents players from memorising answer positions.

- **User Input and Validation:**
  Player choices are mapped to a dictionary of options (`A-D`) so input can be validated consistently. Invalid entries trigger error handling that prompts the user to try again instead of breaking the program.

- **Score Tracking:**
  The player’s score is tracked with a simple integer counter that increments whenever a correct answer is given. At the end of the quiz, this score is compared against thresholds to determine the final message (including the ASCII “superfan” celebration for high scores).

#### Flowchart (Lucidchart)

This lightweight model was chosen deliberately: it avoids unnecessary complexity, keeps the code readable, and allows new categories or questions to be added easily in the future.

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created to showcase the progression of my Python app.  
I've used [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/flowchart-maker) to design my app flowchart.

The diagram provides a **high-level overview** of the program logic.  
It focuses on the main user journey (menu navigation, quiz gameplay, and leaderboard flow) rather than every small detail, in order to keep the structure clear and easy to follow.

![Flowchart of app menu and quiz navigation](docs/lucidchart.png)

#### Flowchart (Mermaid)

To plan out the logic of the Fandom Challenge V2 quiz, a flowchart was created to show the main cycle of the application. It covers everything from starting the quiz, selecting a category, answering questions, and finally saving results to the leaderboard.

The flowchart was designed directly in Markdown using the [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live) library. Mermaid has the advantage of being lightweight and interactive in GitHub, so the diagram can be viewed directly inside the README without requiring a separate image file.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Quiz] --> B[Select Category]
    B --> C[Display Random Question]
    C --> D[Player Answers]
    D --> E{Correct?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Increase Score]
    E -->|No| G[No Score Change]
    F --> H[Next Question]
    G --> H[Next Question]
    H --> I{Questions Left?}
    I -->|Yes| C
    I -->|No| J[Calculate Time]
    J --> K[Update Leaderboard]
    K --> L[Show Results]
```

For maximum compatibility, a static screenshot of the flowchart is also provided below. This ensures that the diagram can be viewed correctly in environments where Mermaid is not supported.

#### Classes & Functions

This project is written in a **modular, function-based style**. Instead of using Python classes, the application is built with a series of reusable functions that handle the core quiz logic, menu navigation, leaderboard integration, and Google Sheets communication.

The primary functions in this application are:

- `menu()`
  - Displays the main menu and directs the user to Rules, About, or Quiz selection.
- `rules()`
  - Outputs the quiz rules in the terminal.
- `about()`
  - Displays information about the project and its purpose.
- `select_quiz()`
  - Provides a sub-menu for choosing between the different fandom quizzes.
- `play_quiz(questions, quiz_name)`
  - Runs the full quiz loop: selecting random questions, shuffling answers, validating input, checking answers, and recording results.
- `save_score(username, score, quiz_name, time_taken)`
  - Appends the player’s result to the relevant Google Sheets leaderboard worksheet.
- `display_leaderboard(quiz_name, top_n=10)`
  - Fetches, sorts, and displays the leaderboard for a chosen quiz.
- Helper logic (e.g., `safe_int`)
  - Ensures robust handling of unexpected input when working with Google Sheets records.

#### Imports

The following Python modules and packages are used:

- `sys` – exits the application cleanly.
- `random` – randomises both question selection and answer order.
- `re` – validates usernames with regular expressions.
- `colorama` – adds coloured text to the terminal for improved UX.
- `gspread` – used with the Google Sheets API to save scores.
- `google.oauth2.service_account` – handles Google Sheets API authentication.
- `datetime` – measures quiz duration for leaderboard sorting.
- `os` & `json` – handle credentials (local file vs. Heroku environment variables).

Together, these imports allow the program to be **interactive**, **colourful**, and **connected to cloud storage** for saving and displaying leaderboards.

## Testing

Testing included:

- Manual testing of input handling and score calculation.
- Verifying randomisation of questions and answer order.
- Deployment testing on Heroku terminal.
- Error handling for invalid input or empty answers.

## Code Validation

### Python

All Python files in this project were validated using the [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com).

#### run.py
- **Result:** No errors found after fixes. Initially, `run.py` had multiple PEP8 issues including:
  - Lines exceeding maximum length (79 characters) (`E501`).
  - Missing blank lines before functions/classes (`E302`, `E305`).
  - Incorrect inline comment spacing (`E261`).
  - Trailing whitespace and incorrect blank lines (`W291`, `W293`).
- **Resolution:**
  - Broke long strings into multiple lines within parentheses.
  - Added required blank lines around functions and classes.
  - Fixed inline comment spacing and removed trailing whitespace.
- **Screenshot:**  
![CI Linter run.py result](testing/runpy-validation.png)
![CI Linter run.py result](testing/runpy-validation-2.png)

#### data.py
- **Result:** No errors found after fixes. Initially, `data.py` had multiple issues including:
  - Syntax/formatting problems (mismatched string concatenation, missing commas).
  - Lines exceeding PEP8 maximum length (79 characters) reported by Flake8.
- **Resolution:**
  - Corrected all syntax and formatting errors.
  - Wrapped or split long lines to comply with PEP8 line-length standards.
  - Re-validated with Flake8 and confirmed zero errors remain.
- **Screenshot:**  
![CI Linter data.py result](testing/datapy-validation.png)
![CI Linter data.py result](testing/datapy-validation-2.png)

#### Summary  
- All Python files pass PEP8 validation.  
- Long lines (`E501`) were corrected by breaking strings inside parentheses, ensuring readability and compliance.  
- No `# noqa` overrides were required.  
- External libraries (e.g., `colorama`, `gspread`, `google-auth`) were not validated, as they are third-party packages.

### Bug Testing Log

I have used manual logs to track bugs during development. Below is a log of the key bugs I fixed during the project:

**Quiz Display Issues:**
- **Bug:** Quiz displayed all questions instead of 10 random.
  - **Observed Behavior:** All questions in the dataset appeared each time a quiz was played.
  - **Cause:** `for` loop iterated over `questions` instead of `selected_questions`.
  - **Resolution:** Changed the loop to `for i, q in enumerate(selected_questions, start=1)`.

**Answer Recognition Bugs:**
- **Bug:** Player answers always marked wrong.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Correct answers were not recognized; even valid choices returned "Wrong!".
  - **Cause:** Original code compared full option strings including old A/B/C/D prefixes.
  - **Resolution:** Stripped original letter prefix using `clean_options = [opt[3:].strip() ...]` and shuffled these clean options.

- **Bug:** Invalid choice error for valid input.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Input like 'A', 'B', etc., sometimes triggered "Invalid choice. Skipping question.".
  - **Cause:** Options were shuffled but mapping to labels was inconsistent.
  - **Resolution:** Added `option_mapping` dictionary mapping new labels A-D to shuffled options and checked input against this mapping.

**Superfan Message Bug:**
- **Bug:** Superfan ASCII displayed even for low scores.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Even scoring 5/10 triggered the superfan message.
  - **Cause:** ASCII print was outside the score check `else` block.
  - **Resolution:** Moved the ASCII celebration inside the `else` block that only executes for `score >= 9`.

**Score/Variable Errors:**
- **Bug:** `NameError: name 'score' is not defined`.
  - **Observed Behavior:** Crash when trying to print final score.
  - **Cause:** Some print statements were accidentally placed outside `play_quiz()` function.
  - **Resolution:** Ensured all `score` references are within the function scope and correctly indented.

**Indentation Issues:**
- **Bug:** Indentation errors.
  - **Observed Behavior:** `IndentationError: expected an indented block`.
  - **Cause:** Some blocks (loops, if/else) were not properly indented after major rewriting.
  - **Resolution:** Fixed all indentation consistently: 4 spaces per level, nested blocks 8+ spaces.

## Defensive Programming

Defensive programming was carefully implemented and tested in the **Fandom Challenge V2** project to ensure the quiz handles invalid inputs gracefully and prevents errors or data corruption.

| Feature | Expectation | Test | Result | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Menu Navigation | User should only be able to select valid menu options (1–4). | Entered invalid options such as letters and numbers outside range. | Invalid input was caught, error message displayed, and menu reprinted. | ![screenshot](testing/menu-invalid.png) |
| Quiz Answer Input | User should only be able to enter A–D (or X to quit). | Entered lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. | All invalid entries rejected with a clear error message; options reprinted. | ![screenshot](testing/answer-invalid.png) |
| Username Input | Usernames must be exactly 3 letters (A–Z). | Tested empty input, numbers, 2 letters, and 4 letters. | Invalid usernames rejected with explanation; valid 3-letter username accepted. | ![screenshot](testing/username-invalid.png) |
| Leaderboard Save | Scores should only save if Google Sheets is available. | Simulated loss of connection to Google Sheets. | Program displayed error message without crashing; score not saved. | ![screenshot](testing/leaderboard-fail.png) |
| Randomisation | Questions and answer order should be different each game. | Played multiple quizzes in a row. | Verified that questions and option order were shuffled each time. | ![screenshot](testing/randomisation.png) ![screenshot](testing/randomisation-2.png) |

### Summary
- **Invalid input handling:** Menus, answers, and usernames all reject invalid input until valid entries are provided.
- **Data integrity:** Scores only saved if the Google Sheets connection succeeds, with fallback to local play.
- **Randomisation:** Ensures fairness and prevents memorising answer positions.
- **User experience:** Helpful error messages guide players back on track without crashing the program.

### User Story Testing

All user stories were tested during development and confirmed to pass successfully.

| User Story | How It Was Addressed | Pass |

| As a player, I want to see my final score at the end so that I can measure my performance for that session. | At the end of the quiz, total correct answers are displayed out of the total number of questions. | Yes |
| As a player, I want different outcomes depending on my score so that the game feels more rewarding and dynamic. | Score thresholds trigger different feedback messages, e.g., "Congratulations! You're a superfan!" for 9/10 or above. | Yes |
| As a player, I want to be able to play another quiz without restarting the program so that I can quickly try again if I want to improve. | Options loop back to quiz menu during and after a quiz, allowing the player to select another category or retry. | Yes |
| As a player, I want a timer to run in the background so that I feel more challenge and urgency while answering. | Completion time is tracked and recorded on the leaderboard, adding pressure and urgency to each question. | Yes |
| As a player, I want the timer to affect leaderboard rankings so that the game rewards quick thinking in addition to accuracy. | Leaderboard scores are calculated with correctness as the primary factor and time taken as a secondary tiebreaker. | Yes |
| As a competitive player, I want to see a persistent leaderboard of high scores so that I can compare my results with others or past runs. | Google Sheets integration stores and retrieves high scores across sessions. | Yes |

## Deployment

This project was developed using the [Code Institute Python Essentials Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template), which provides a terminal view for Python applications in the browser.  
This improves accessibility by allowing users to run the project directly online without needing to install Python locally.

The live deployed site can be found here:  
[Fandom Challenge V2 on Heroku](https://fandom-challenge-v2-a2c443c8af3e.herokuapp.com)

### Heroku Deployment

This project is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a cloud platform that runs applications directly from GitHub repositories.  
The live deployed app can be found here:  
[Fandom Challenge V2 on Heroku](https://fandom-challenge-v2-a2c443c8af3e.herokuapp.com/)

#### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create a new Heroku app**
   - From the Heroku dashboard, click **New > Create new app**.
   - Choose a unique name and select your closest region (EU or USA).

2. **Set Config Vars**
   - Go to **Settings > Reveal Config Vars** and add:
     - `PORT` = `8000`
     - `CREDS` = Paste the JSON content of your Google Cloud service account credentials.

3. **Add Buildpacks**
   - In **Settings > Buildpacks**, add the following in this order:
     - `heroku/python`
     - `heroku/nodejs` (required by the Code Institute template).
   - Make sure Python is listed first.

4. **Push Required Files**
   - Ensure the following are in your repository:
     - `requirements.txt` – lists Python dependencies.
     - `Procfile` – tells Heroku how to run the app (`worker: python run.py`).
     - `.python-version` – specifies the Python version (e.g., `3.12`).

5. **Connect to GitHub**
   - Under **Deploy > Deployment method**, select GitHub and connect your repository.

6. **Deploy**
   - Either enable **Automatic Deploys** (recommended) or deploy manually using:
     ```bash
     git push heroku main
     ```

#### Notes

- The `CREDS` config var replaces the local `quiz_creds.json` file.  
- Python must be listed **before** Node.js in the buildpacks.  
- The app uses the Code Institute template, which requires both Python and Node.js.

### Google Sheets API

This project uses [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) as a lightweight cloud-based database to store and retrieve quiz leaderboard data.

Each quiz has its own dedicated worksheet inside the main Google Sheet named `fandom-challenge-v2-data`. For example:
- `jak_leaderboard`
- `ratchet_leaderboard`
- `gow_leaderboard`

When a player finishes a quiz, their username, score, and time taken are appended to the relevant leaderboard sheet. The leaderboards are then read back, sorted, and displayed directly in the terminal.

#### Credentials Setup

To connect your own copy of this project to Google Sheets, you will need API credentials in `.JSON` format from the [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com).

1. From the dashboard, click on **Select a project**, then **NEW PROJECT**.
2. Give the project a name, then click **CREATE**.
3. Select the project to enter its dashboard.
4. From the left-hand menu, choose **APIs & Services** > **Library**.
5. Enable both:
   - **Google Drive API**
   - **Google Sheets API**
6. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
7. Click **Create Credentials** and select **Service Account**.
8. Assign a name, click **Create**, then under **Role** choose **Basic** > **Editor**.
9. Continue, then click **Done**.
10. Open the new service account → **Keys** → **Add Key** → **Create new key** → choose `JSON`.
11. Download the credentials file.
    - For local development: rename it `quiz_creds.json` and place it in your project root.
    - For deployment (e.g., Heroku): copy the contents into a Config Var named `CREDS`.
12. Open your Google Sheet (`fandom-challenge-v2-data`) and share it with the `client_email` from the `quiz_creds.json`, granting **Editor** access.
13. Ensure your `quiz_creds.json` file is added to `.gitignore` so it is not pushed to GitHub.

The only difference lies in **how Google Sheets credentials are handled**:

- **Local Development**
  - Requires a `quiz_creds.json` file in the project root.
  - This file contains the Google Cloud service account credentials in JSON format.
  - The `run.py` script loads credentials from this file when run locally.

- **Heroku Deployment**
  - Instead of a file, the same JSON is stored in the `CREDS` config var in Heroku’s environment settings.
  - The app reads this environment variable, parses it with `json.loads()`, and authenticates with Google Sheets.
  - No physical credentials file is needed in the deployed app.

Aside from this difference in credentials handling, both versions of the project work identically:
- The menu system runs the same.
- Quizzes are randomised in the same way.
- Scores are saved to the same Google Sheet leaderboards.

## Credits

I would like to thank the following people and resources for their support and guidance throughout this project:

- **Tim (mentor):** For his valuable feedback, encouragement, and guidance throughout development. We had three scheduled calls: at project inception, midway through development and at project completion. He advised me to do a quiz for this project and to avoid grid systems to keep things simple. He also taught me about the importance of keeping the user in a loop until they enter a valid response to ensure that the project won't break.

- **Code Institute:** for the deployment template.

- **Code Institute LMS:** For teaching me Python, and web design principles through detailed walkthroughs and exercises.

- **Code Institute sample README.md for Project 3:** Used as inspiration for structuring the **How to Play** and **Data Model** sections in this README.
